    <h1>Clash! 6/17</h1>
    Changes ahoy.
    Minor bug was fixed when closing the subcard and trying to re-open the same one (Required double clicking.)
    </br>
    Larger change, expanded the base size of the 'Pinned' Window to make it a bit more different than the regular subcard. (Which now doesn't close by default anyway.)
    </br> This was to make way for adding tabs, so you don't need to open/close/click-too-far to get to the next monster when doing your rolls.
    </br> The new size isn't HUGE, and likely won't be until I find a clever way to allow for resizing.
    </br> Enjoy.
    <h1>Clash! 4/29</h1>
    Minor fix; Stopped the turn label from scaling/spinning with it's parent token.
    </br>
    <h1>Clash! 4/29</h1>
    Minor fix; Apparently negative 'to-hit' rolls didn't work when you put '-5'.
    </br> Thank you Wisdom Hunter for the report. I never knew about it. ðŸ˜¬
    <h1>Clash! 4/28</h1>
    After .. months. And months. And months.
    </br>I finally updated the help documents.
    </br>The documents will be updated on the OBR store page after they do their next refresh.
    </br>But for now you can access it via a new help button on the bottom on the list.
    </br>Hope this helps!

    <h1>Clash! 4/25</h1>
    QoL Time! Slowly working through it all.
    </br> As suggested by a user, clicking the UnitInfo button in the Initiative List while that unit's card is open will now close the window.
    </br> Also, the close button is now 'static' so even if you scroll down, it's always easily accessible.
    </br> Since Bones! is now in the OBR store, I've enabled the integration for it incase you want to use that roller with Clash.
    </br> Some general stability updates, some seeing some extensions are loading before scenes are fully in.
    </br> Enjoy!
    <h1>Clash! 4/13</h1>
    Allowed up to four 'characters' in the Initiative Input. In case you need to do a 12.3 and 12.4.
    </br>
    <h1>Clash! 4/12</h1>
    Minor bug fix for Open5e not being available; It'll now show an error message if that's the case and not just tank your search. So you can still use the collection. Sorry!
